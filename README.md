In this project, I created a mobile app called Coin Card that encourages people to make donation with a small amounts. I completed UX design process from research to prototype.

- Researched to learn target users with realistic contexts and analyzed competitors to have insights for design processes.
- Conducted design thinking process from identifying user paint points and opportunities, and brainstorming ideations to prioritize it for goals of the project.
- Created user personas, journey maps, storyboards, user workflows driven by the key knowledge.
- Refined app design with sketch ideas, and tested wireframes to create a high fidelity prototype with Adobe XD for usability testing.
